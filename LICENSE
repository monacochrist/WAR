1.
This license enshrines eternal source-code transparency while allowing absolute
freedom to use, modify, commercialize, share, impose paywalls, require license
keys, block execution, and redistribute. Its only binding principle is that the
complete source code must always remain publicly available, including all
mechanisms used to restrict, monetize, or control execution. All other freedoms
are explicitly permitted.

2.
"Software"
The Software encompasses all original works, including source code, build
scripts, configuration files, license-verification logic, cryptographic checks,
and documentation provided by the Licensor.
"Source Code"
The preferred form for human understanding and modification, including but not
limited to:
All human-readable code
Build systems and scripts
Configuration logic
License-verification or restriction algorithms
Any code used to enforce payment, keys, DRM, or execution control
"Binary"
Any compiled, packaged, or non-source form of the Software.
"Derivative Work"
Any work based on, incorporating, modifying, extending, linking against,
embedding, or otherwise derived from the Software, in whole or in part.
"Publicly Available"
Source code is considered publicly available if it is accessible to the general
public without requiring payment, approval, or authentication beyond standard
internet access.

3.
Bound by the spirit of this License, you are granted irrevocable, worldwide,
royalty-free permission to:
Use the Software for any purpose your heart desires
Modify the Software
Create Derivative Works
Distribute the Software or Derivative Works
Commercialize the Software or Derivative Works
Sell access, binaries, licenses, subscriptions, or services
Impose license keys, paywalls, DRM, execution blocking, or any other
technical or contractual restriction on Binaries
There are no restrictions on pricing, business models, or commercial terms.

4.
Any Derivative Work must be licensed exclusively under this same WAR LICENSE.
You may not:
Re-license the Software or any Derivative Work under a different license
Add additional restrictions that conflict with this License
Remove or weaken the obligations defined in this License
This requirement applies regardless of whether the Derivative Work is
distributed for free or sold.

5.
If you distribute the Software or any Derivative Work in any form, including
Binaries:
The complete Source Code must be made Publicly Available
The Source Code must include:
All modifications
All added components
All license-verification, monetization, or restriction logic
The Source Code must be available at no cost
The Source Code must be available for as long as the Binary is distributed or
usable
Providing only partial source code is not sufficient.

6.
Unlike traditional licenses, this License explicitly permits:
Blocking execution of the Software
Requiring license keys or files
Enforcing payment prior to execution
Limiting functionality without authorization
Implementing DRM or verification systems
Provided that:
All such mechanisms are fully disclosed in the publicly available Source Code.

7.
This License does not require that Binaries be provided free of charge. You may:
Sell Binaries
Paywall downloads
Require payment for keys or access
Refuse to distribute Binaries entirely
The obligation applies only to Source Code availability, not Binary
availability.

8.
All copies of the Software must retain:
This License text
Copyright notices
Derivatives are **not required to provide attribution to the original author**.
You may include additional attribution if desired, but it is entirely optional.
Attribution notices from the original may remain, but may also be removed in
derivatives.

9.
Derivatives may freely reuse, modify, or ignore trademarks, logos, and branding
associated with the Software.

10.
Any violation of this License automatically terminates your rights under this
License. Upon termination:
You must cease distribution immediately
Previously granted rights to compliant recipients remain valid

11.
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

12.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR
DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION.

13.
If any provision of this License is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions
shall remain in full force and effect.

This License constitutes the entire agreement governing use of the Software.
